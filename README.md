# Another Bootstrap Dashboard
Another dashboard lab done with Bootstrap 4. This is a prototype solution for problem 2 of Anthony's website.

**Problem 2:**
>"Anthony would like you to design the user interface that would allow him to edit, categorize, and publish recipes. Anthony gets a lot of recipes but he can only publish about 1 or 2 per week. He would like it to be easy for him to look at every recipe received, in order which they were received, and make a quick decision on each one:
>- skip it entirely
>- save it for later, or
>- proceed with editing and publishing <br/>
>If he looked at the “save for later” list, it would be really nice to be able to see which
categories each recipe was saved under. For example, if he was looking for a recipe to
do, he might look what he saved under the ‘Holidays’ category. Since he has a backlog of recipes sent to him via email, Anthony would also like to be able to create a “new” recipe easily, where he enters all the data for it from the start. "
